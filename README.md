# Test-Driven Development with C#
## Basic Console Application

### What is this?

This is a lesson project I completed while attending Epicoodus in September of 2023. It's a C# .NET Basic Console Application that keeps track of orders for a small Bakery called Pierre's.

### Technologies Used

1. C#

2. .NET

3. MSTest

### Setup/Installation Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open your terminal (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) and navigate to this project's production directory called "Bakery".
3. In the command line, run the command "dotnet run" to compile and execute the console application. Since this is a console application, you'll interact with it through text commands in your terminal.
4. Optionally, you can run "dotnet build" to compile this console app without running it.

### Running tests with MSTest

1. Navigate to the test directory "Bakery.Tests"
2. In your cosole type "dotnet test"
